    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat oil in a pan. Add green cardamoms & onions. Stir fry until they turn transparent to light pink. (If you do not have ginger garlic paste for this recipe, you may add chopped ginger and garlic along with onions)</li>
      <li>Next, add tomatoes & salt. Saute for 3 minutes. Cover and cook till the onion & tomatoes turn soft & completely mushy.</li>
      <li>Add garam masala, coriander powder, cashew nuts, red chili powder & sugar (optional).</li>
      <li>Stir fry this till the onion tomato masala turns aromatic. This takes 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
      <li>Turn off the stove & cool this completely.</li>
      <li>Transfer to a blender & pour water. Blend to a really silky smooth puree. If it is not smooth, filter it through a strainer to another bowl. Set this aside.</li>
      <li>Heat butter in the same pan. Optional - When the butter melts, add cinnamon, cloves, green cardamoms & bay leaf.</li>
      <li>Reduce the flame to low, and saute ginger garlic paste for a minute until it smells aromatic.</li>
      <li>Stir in the blended onion tomato puree. Taste test your puree & optionally you may add more red chili powder for a deeper color.</li>
      <li>Pour more water & mix well. Bring it to a rolling boil. Reduce the heat to medium and cook covered until the gravy cooks down to a thicker consistency. Keep stirring every few minutes.</li>
      <li>You know the gravy is done when it turns thick and traces of fat are visible on the gravy. Taste test and add more salt or garam masala if needed.</li>
      <li>Lower the flame completely, and add cubed paneer. Take dried fenugreek leaves to your palm and crush it in between your palms. Sprinkle this.</li>
      <li>Mix & cook covered on low heat for 2 minutes. Turn off and pour cream (save some for garnish) & stir.</li>
      <li>Transfer paneer butter masala to a serving bowl. Garnish with more cream & chopped coriander leaves. Serve this with butter naan, Basmati rice, or jeera rice.</li>
    </ol>
